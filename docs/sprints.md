# Sprints

Sprints are goal-based, not time-boxed: a sprint ends when its exit criteria hold. Every card carries a Sprint field on the board (IDs in `docs/agents/board.md`). The orchestrator works one sprint at a time and does not pull cards from a later sprint until the current one exits.

**Ordering rule.** Each screen is designed in the sprint that builds it, or the one just before. Foundations rules come first so every later screen is built responsive from day one. The one exception is mobile boards, which wait for Sprint 5.

## Sprint 0 · Agent setup

**Goal:** agents can work the board without asking how.

- Product and stack decisions written down (`docs/product/mvp1.md`).
- Canvas rules and tokens written down (`docs/agents/design-canvas.md`).
- Board protocol: Owner claim, card size and splits, done bars per card type, blocked flow, worktree → PR flow (`docs/agents/board.md`).
- `/orchestrate` skill; `card-designer`, `card-builder`, `sandbox-security-reviewer` agents.
- `.claude/settings.json`: board and git allowlist, secret-file edit block. Svelte MCP in `.mcp.json`.
- Board: Owner and Sprint fields; `architecture` label.
- Machine-independent: all state on GitHub and the canvas; project settings install the plugins the workflow uses, so `/orchestrate` resumes the same from any local clone. Cloud sessions are not supported (no plugins, no `gh project`).

**Exit:** all of the above committed on `main`.

## Sprint 1 · Design foundations

**Goal:** MVP1 is specified, and every screen on the skeleton path is designed.

- **Spec (with the maintainer):** `domain-modeling` → `CONTEXT.md`; ADRs for the decisions in `mvp1.md`; `to-spec`; `codebase-design` for the module map.
- **Foundations (one lane, first):** F1 result states, F2 core/extra marker + issue link, F3 mobile rules.
- **Skeleton screens (parallel lanes, after F):** P1 Map nav + search, P3 Topic as chapters → problems, R1 Chapter → Topic + problems, P7 language picker + report link, P8 run/submit states, P9 Accepted panel, S1 Local nav.

**Exit:** all 10 cards Done; `CONTEXT.md`, ADRs, spec and module map merged.

## Sprint 2 · Walking skeleton

**Goal:** one problem works end to end in Local mode, shipped as a released image.

- Scaffold: SvelteKit + Bun + Prisma/SQLite + Biome + Vitest + Playwright.
- CI, release-please, the multi-arch GHCR image, `init` + `compose.yaml`, the runner sandbox.
- Map → Topic → Chapter → Problem → run → Accepted, in Python, TypeScript and Go.
- A PostToolUse hook runs Biome on edited files.

**Exit:** `docker compose up` from a released image solves that one problem; CI green on `main`.

**Status (2026-10-04):** exit met on release `v0.21.0`: `init` + `docker compose up` from the published image, then the smoke test solved the fixture Problem in Python, TypeScript and Go. Open: C10b, the first real Topic, Chapter and Problem (needs the maintainer's source verification); until it lands the image ships the fixture content. Decided along the way: our own Sandbox images for TypeScript and Go (ADR 0002, amended), TypeScript type errors are Compile Errors, releases publish `vX.Y.Z` and `latest` only after the full CI run on the released source, `edge` on every merge.

## Sprint 3 · Learning loop

**Goal:** the full single-learner experience.

- Design: P5 Hints tab, P6 Solution tab (always visible), AC1 Settings (Local variant).
- Build: topic hard-locks and completion (all chapters read + core problems solved), core/extra problems, hints, the always-visible Solution tab, the topic-complete Accepted variant, report-an-issue links, Settings.

**Exit:** a learner in Local mode can finish a topic and unlock the next; all Sprint 3 cards Done.

## Sprint 4 · Multi-user

**Goal:** one instance serves a group.

- Design: AD1 first-run setup, A1 Sign in (local ± GitHub/Google), A3 Sign up (open registration), A4 Accept invite, AD2 Users page.
- Build: first-run mode choice, Better Auth with local accounts and optional OAuth, open / invite-only registration, admin password reset, per-user progress.

**Exit:** an admin can set up, invite a user, and that user signs in and keeps their own progress.

## Sprint 5 · Mobile

**Goal:** everything in MVP1 works on a phone, including writing code.

- Design: P2 Map, P4 Topic, R2 Chapter, P10 Problem (tabs), A2 Sign in.
- Build: those layouts, following the F3 rules already applied since Sprint 2.

**Exit:** Playwright mobile-viewport runs pass for each of those screens; MVP1 as written in `docs/product/mvp1.md` ships as release `v1.0.0`: the last commit of the sprint carries a `Release-As: 1.0.0` footer, so release-please makes it the first major release. Until then every release stays `0.x`.

## After each build sprint

Code cards for Sprints 2–5 come from the spec via `to-tickets` when the sprint starts. When a sprint's features land, `improve-codebase-architecture` turns friction into `architecture` issues for later.
